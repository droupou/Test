					<li>System Administrator: I acted as network administrator for the Tulsa office. I assisted in setting up the companies Active Directory Domain Server. The server was then moved to the office in Washington D.C. Once there I was asked to assist in administrating it. I setup the IIS server and installed the YARDI software, and the MSSQL server that it uses.</li>
					<li>IT: I was one of two people who act as the IT staff for the company. I maintained the laptops, and network for the Tulsa office, setup service with Rackspace for the AptBudget software package we were developing. Assisted in software purchasing decisions, and have helped to create a corporate computer policy.</li>
					<li>SQL Programmer: I am one of four programmers at EverGreen solutions. We create reports for an SQL database and output them using the Yardi Voyager software which utilizes a proprietary output, crystal reports, or Adobe PDF.</li>
					<li>Technical Support: I setup our current technical support group. I reviewed, selected, and purchased the software EverGreen currently uses for tracking trouble tickets. I setup standards, and goals for the support team.</li>
					<li>Applications Programmer. I am lead programmer in charge of finishing the AptBudget program using VB .NET. I was responsible for assigning duties to the other programmer assigned to the program. I am in the process of cleaning up the code. This program has been sold to a client company who I am currently turning the program over to.</li>
					<li>Overview: At EverGreen Solutions I began by working on SQL scripted reporting for YARDI systems. The reports written where large queries designed to draw accounting and statistical data from the MSSQL back end to the YARDI system. More recently I was asked to assist in beginning the AptBudget program. During the specification gathering process, the project was transferred to another employee, who wrote the program without specifications. At the point the company attempted to sell the project to Real Page, it was determined that more structured programming was necessary, and the project was turned over to me to fix the source code. I rewrote a large portion of the software to use classes, and functions, as well as standardizing the interface. Once the source code was turned over to Real Page, I began writing documentation describing what the program was supposed to do. I wrote a report parser that allowed users to use XML to write custom reports.</li>

			<li>Applications programmer: I was the primary programmer for the Retail Merchandise Authorization software using the visual basic programming language, an MSSQL server back end. I assisted in the programming for the Customer Relations Management (CRM) software used by the customer service department, and later the technical support team to streamline the clients support experience.</li> 
			<li>Server Administrator: I was responsible for the administration of the NT/Windows 2000 server as well as the software maintenance/production.</li>
			<li>Technical supervisor: I was responsible for the supervision of 5 employees in the RMA department. Their primary responsibility was to test customer products and repair those with defects. I also assisted the Manager with inventory control, and area security.</li>
			<li>E-mail and phone support technician: I was responsible for the support of Creative labs hardware on Windows platform.</li> 
			<li>Overview: I started as a phone support technician, and was transferred to the email support group. I was promoted to the position of Supervisor in the RMA department. The department used a software package developed by previous supervisors who had no previous programming experience. In reviewing the software, I found it to be lacking in a number of key features, and spoke to my manager regarding the software. When I started in the department, the program tracked the clients name, address, and phone number, the RMA number and a general description of the product. Additional data was hand written on sheets of paper printed out when the product arrived. Printing these sheets out was also a manual process, in that the RMA had to be looked up based on the RMA number when provided, or the customers name if not. When I left the company, the RMA program allowed the support agent to enter the clients name, address, and phone number, and required a serial number in order to complete the process. The serial number would have to match a template as verification of the model number, thus giving us an exact card to match to. Upon arrival the receiving agent could scan the serial number bar code, and the system would match it to the RMA which would be verified by the receiving agent. In the event that the serial number didn't match due to input error, the RMA number could be manually looked up. Each station had a hand held scanner, and the product was scanned anytime it moved from one station to another. Test Codes, and Repair codes were used to determine what the product had undergone. At any point, we could look a product up in the system for a customer, and know precisely where it was at. When the product was shipped back out, the return was scanned in as well, and if an email address was on record, the client would receive an automated email to let them know the product had been shipped out, and what the UPS tracking code was. Additionally we could pull up statistics on employee performance, repair and replacement trends, as well as other significant trend data.</li>
